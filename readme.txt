Please answer the following question in a concise and short manner. The answer should not need more
than 3 or 4 sentences.

1) What is the difference between AAR and JAR?
AAR stands for "Android Archive" and it is used to package Android Library modules.
It contains the Android Library's code and resources, as well as metadata about the library such as its AndroidManifest file.
JAR stands for "Java Archive" and it is a file format used to package Java classes and resources. 
It is typically used to distribute Java libraries and programs.

2) What is an Intent?
Intent is an object that is used to request an action from another app component,
such as starting an activity, starting a service, delivering a broadcast, or displaying a message.
They allow for loosely coupled communication between app components, 
which makes it easier to write and maintain code, and allows for greater flexibility and reuse.

3) What is a layout?
a layout is a file that defines the visual structure for a user interface, such as an activity or a fragment.
It specifies the positions and sizes of the UI elements, such as buttons, text views, and image views, on the screen.
They are defined in XML files, which can be inflated and rendered by the Android framework to create the UI.

4) What is adb?
ADB stands for Android Debug Bridge. It is a command-line tool that is used to build and run Android apps on a computer. 
It allows the user to communicate with an Android device, either an emulator or a physical device,
to perform various tasks such as debugging, installing apps etc.

5) What is a Fragment?
Fragment is a piece of an activity that represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an activity.
They have their own lifecycle and can be added, removed, and replaced in an activity at runtime

6) What is the difference between an activity and a service and where would you use one or the other?
An Activity is a UI component that represents a screen or a part of a screen in an Android app.
It provides a window in which the app can draw its UI, and it handles user interactions with the UI.
An activity can display a UI, receive user inputs and perform background tasks.

A Service, on the other hand, is a non-UI component that is used to perform tasks in the background,
such as playing music, downloading files, or performing network operations. 
A service does not provide a user interface and it's intended to perform tasks that do not need direct interaction with the user.
